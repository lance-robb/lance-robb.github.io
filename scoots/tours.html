                <h2>How To Drive Round Cozumel</h2>

                <p> Renting a car is a great way to get around the island independently and really enjoy all it has to
                    offer.</p>
                <p>A popular route is to take the highway south out of town, stopping at Discover Mexico and then
                    continuing on to visit Chankanaab Beach Park or one of the other great beaches on the west coast.
                </p>
                <p>Next, take the highway round the south part of the island, stop at Punta Sur if you have time, then
                    drive north up the wild east coast - simply known locally as the Other Side. Stop at one of the many
                    beautiful white sand beaches for lunch.</p>
                <p>Spend the afternoon on the beach or on the drive back you could stop at San Gervasio, the Mayan
                    Encounter or downtown for some shopping.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Punta Sur Park</h2>

                <p>Stunning white sand beach with reef for drift snorkeling and crystal clear water at Punta Sur Park
                    ecological reserve.</p>
                <p>Entrance to the reserve also includes the historic lighthouse, where you can climb up to see some
                    amazing views, a small maritime museum and eco-bus transport to the beach.</p>
                <p>A boat trip on the lagoon is also available for the chance to see crocodiles and other wildlife.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Chankanaab All-Inclusive Beach Tour</h2>

                <p>Everything you need for a fun-filled day at Cozumel's most famous beach park, including transport,
                    entrance, sea lion show, snorkel gear and guide, buffet lunch and full access to all the facilities.
                </p>

                <p>The snorkel guide at the beach will help fit you out with equipment and, if you ask and they are
                    available, he or she will be pleased to show you the best spots to snorkel in the crystal clear
                    protected Marine Park waters too.</p>

                <p>You can relax on the large white sand beach and enjoy a full Mexican buffet lunch with drinks in one
                    of the restaurants.</p>

                <p>Don't miss the famous sea lion show either, when you arrive they will let you know the times of the
                    performances.</p>

                <p>Later you can learn about Mayan culture and history as you explore the jungle area with replica
                    ruins. Complete with wooden huts where you can try corn tortillas hand-made using centuries old
                    traditional techniques.</p>

                <p>Become fascinated with what you learn on the eco-arqueological tour and stare deep into the turquiose
                    blue lagoon.</p>

                <p>You won't believe how much you can pack into one day in Cozumel! </p>

                <h2>Book a Cozumel rental now!</h2>

                <p>If you rent a vehicle whilst in Cozumel why not take a look at our island driving tips? From parking
                    to bumps in the road, find some great advice in this quick guide.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Almost all downtown roads that run north-south, parallel to the seafront, have priority.
                        Roads running east-west must yield.</li>

                    <li>Most downtown roads are one-way. Look for arrows on the street name signs, black and white
                        arrow signs on corners or just check which direction cars are parked in.</li>

                    <li>Don't park on red curbs. It means no parking and the police may take your car or plates and
                        fine you. If there is no red curb you still can't park if cars are parked on the other side of
                        the street - 'double file' parking is not permitted downtown.</li>

                    <li>Beware of topes, the local speed bumps in the road. They are mainly downtown, but there are
                        some on the roads around the island too. They're not always clearly marked and can be quite a
                        shock to you and your car if you hit them at speed.</li>

                    <li>We've seen too many scooter accidents, even with experienced riders. So stay safe on
                        vacation, don't rent a scooter unless you really understand the high risk you're taking. If you
                        do, make sure you wear a good helmet, protective clothing and expect the unexpected.</li>

                    <li>Why close yourself inside an expensive air-conditioned rental when you can have real fun in
                        an open top?!</li>

                    <li>Be careful at intersections with the new 4 lane highway on parts of the island. If you're not
                        sure if you have right-of-way, proceed with caution!</li>

                    <li>When renting, pay the extra for comprehensive insurance! It's STRONGLY recommended.</li>

                    <li>Enjoy your vacation but please be responsible - drinking and driving is illegal and
                        dangerous here too.</li>
